<p>
Have a good Estimate of number of unique elements in a list 
whithout having O(n) space for a map.
</p>

<p>
do it in O(1) memory (may be in O(loglogn)
</p>

<div id="problem-idea"><h2 id="idea" class="header"><a href="#problem-idea">idea</a></h2></div>

<p>
given a random binary number 
the probabilty that the number starts with k zeros is pow(2,k)
Now this also means that in a given sample if we have tracked the max number of starting zero's to be say k
we can estimate that there are pow(2, k) unique elements in the sample.
</p>

<p>
but 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
we need to map some arbitary entry i.e struct into a binary number 

<li>
also make sure that it behaves as if as a random mapping to binary number 

<li>
also make sure that the same elements should be mapped to the same binary numbers 

</ul>
<p>
This can be achived by a hash function.
</p>

<p>
But our estimate is not good with just the following so we make it good by diving the whole into parts and use
some statistics to get a better estimate
