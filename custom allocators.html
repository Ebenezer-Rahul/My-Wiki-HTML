<li>
avoid fragmentation

<li>
1 =&gt; better use of memory

<li>
Avoid book keeping 

<li>
make better deallocations

<li>
make allocated memory volatile for multi threaded application

</ol>

say we use new for all allocations, say 
we allocate a vector&lt;int&gt; of size n
then we allocate a set and instert some elements
then allocate a map then insert some more elements
then insert some more set elements and map elements .
and say set goes out of scope then now our memory looks very fragmented.
</p>

<p>
so we can use a pool allocater 
which is an allocater for objects of fixed size 
this would greatly reduce fragmentation

Less fragmentation =&gt; better use of memory

<p>
say when we are deallocating an object we don't specify its size 
so the allocater is storing this on heap for most part
</p>

<p>
_not totally sure as it may be something we could figure out at compile time or may be use _<em>vptr to find out at runtime but not totally sure on this one but mostly true for array's but that won't be solved using a pool allocater</em>

<p>
say we know we have set&lt;unique_ptr&lt;A*&gt;&gt; that goes out of scope. it calls deallocate for every ptr.. we can just note that and deallocate all of them at once when its done

<p>
making sure that these are volatile.. i guess don't know enough
