<div id="Types"><h1 id="Types" class="header"><a href="#Types">Types</a></h1></div>

<p>
My Understanding of types was intially based on structs from c. 
</p>

<p>
Formalizing my understanding it's like 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Types-type is a set of values"></span><strong id="type is a set of values">type is a set of values</strong>

<li>
Example <em>a set of all integers from -pow(2, 31) to pow(2, 31) - 1. -&gt; int</em>

<li>
<em>set of true, false -&gt; boolen type</em>

<li>
<em>{x* | x belongs to chars union epsilon } -&gt; string</em>

</ul>
<p>
This way of thinking about types I think works in functional paradiams. 
Thinking of types this way helps in thinking about compostion of function etc..
</p>

<p>
<span id="Types-But Object Oriented Languages require you to think of type in a different way"></span><strong id="But Object Oriented Languages require you to think of type in a different way">But Object Oriented Languages require you to think of type in a different way</strong>
</p>

<p>
Here Type is thought of as set operations|requests|methods 
</p>

<p>
we say an object is of type T if the object supports all the operations in T
</p>

<p>
So a single object can be many types T1, T2 etc..
</p>

<p>
I do think this way of understaning types helps to write more naturally in object oriented languages
</p>

<p>
I think go defines types this way.
</p>

<p>
But in c++ this way of thinking won't always work. due to fact of object slicing etc.. but we just limit
to thinking of types this way for purly abstract classes {I mean like an interface in Java} in c++ . 
This way of reasong about code certainly helps designing good applications
